## Project Description

Kaggle non-financial competition with the following goals:

- Develop algorithms to estimate given house prices as precisely as possible (lowest RMSE), aiming to score as high as possible in the leaderboard
- Apply knowledge learned within this course to improve Machine Learning skills

## Why This Project?

Our team considered this project suitable for multiple reasons:

- **Straightforward problem** - features are easy to interpret
- **Huge variety of features** - provides room for optimizations, analytics, and trying different ML algorithms
- **Hosted on Kaggle** - results can be evaluated immediately against leaderboards

## Setup

To set up the project and validate your Kaggle access, run the steps in `src/setup_env.ipynb`. Completing that notebook ensures you can download the competition data locally.

NOTE: Most Kaggle competitions forbid sharing raw data publicly, so double-check that downloaded files stay in `.gitignore`. The `setup_env` notebook already enforces this.
